I’m a Ph.D. candiate based in Hangzhou ⛵ at Westlake Univeristy and Zhejiang University.

My focus area for the past few years has been AI for Science, especially Biology, but I’m also keen to study the most recent AI techniques, including Diffusion Models, Large Language Model or Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback.
